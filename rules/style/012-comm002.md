Title: Use TODO/FIXME/HACK tags to flag issues for future maintainers
ID: COMM002
Description:
Use standardized tags like TODO, FIXME, and HACK to clearly communicate known issues and improvement opportunities to future maintainers. These tags make it easy to search for and prioritize technical debt across the codebase.

Problems with vague improvement comments:
- They're hard to find and track across the codebase
- Priority and urgency are unclear
- They lack searchable, standardized format
- Team members may not notice them during code review
- They don't indicate whether the issue affects functionality
- No clear ownership or timeline is established

Solutions for effective tagging:
- Use TODO for planned improvements and missing features
- Use FIXME for bugs and issues that need correction
- Use HACK for temporary workarounds that need proper solutions
- Include specific descriptions of what needs to be done
- Add owner and date information when possible
- Set up automated tools to track and report on these tags
- Review tags regularly during code maintenance cycles

Before:
```python
# need better algorithm
```

After:
```python
# TODO: Replace O(n^2) loop with hashmap for faster lookup
```
