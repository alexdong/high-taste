Title: Remove commented‑out code from version‑controlled files
ID: COM003
Description:
Commented-out code should be removed from version-controlled files rather than left as inactive code blocks. Version control systems provide history and recovery mechanisms, making commented code redundant and harmful to readability.

Problems with commented-out code:
- Creates visual clutter and reduces readability
- Confuses developers about what code is active
- Accumulates over time creating maintenance debt
- May contain outdated logic that misleads developers
- Suggests uncertainty about whether the code should be removed
- Makes it harder to find relevant comments

Solutions for managing old code:
- Delete unused code and rely on version control history
- Use feature flags for temporary code disabling
- Create clear documentation about removed functionality
- Use proper branching strategies for experimental code
- Add meaningful commit messages when removing code

Before:
```python
# def old_api():
#     pass
```

After:
```python
# (deleted old_api; see git history)
```
