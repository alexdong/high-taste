Title: Use TODO/FIXME comments sparingly and with an owner/date
ID: COM005
Description:
TODO and FIXME comments should be used judiciously and include ownership and timeline information. Without this context, they become abandoned technical debt that clutters the codebase without providing actionable information.

Problems with vague TODO comments:
- They accumulate indefinitely without resolution
- They lack ownership and accountability
- They provide no timeline or priority information
- They become stale and irrelevant over time
- They create uncertainty about current code quality
- They make it hard to distinguish critical from minor issues

Solutions for effective TODO management:
- Include owner name or team responsible
- Add date when TODO was created
- Provide specific description of what needs to be done
- Use issue tracking systems for complex TODOs
- Set up regular reviews to clean up stale TODOs
- Consider creating tickets instead of inline comments
- Use FIXME for bugs and TODO for improvements

Before:
```python
# TODO: refactor
```

After:
```python
# TODO(alex, 2025‑07‑27): replace with strategy pattern
```
