Title: Keep variable declarations close to their usage
ID: FMT005
Description:
Variables should be declared as close as possible to where they are first used. This reduces cognitive load by making the relationship between declaration and usage immediately visible, and it helps prevent bugs from uninitialized or incorrectly initialized variables.

Problems with distant variable declarations:
- Developers must scroll up to find variable initialization
- Increased cognitive load trying to track variable state
- Higher risk of using variables before proper initialization
- Variables may be initialized with wrong values for their actual use
- Code becomes harder to refactor and reorganize
- Unused variables are less obvious when far from usage

Solutions for close variable declarations:
- Declare variables in the smallest possible scope
- Initialize variables just before their first use
- Use loop variables declared in the loop statement
- Avoid declaring all variables at function start
- Group related variable declarations together
- Consider splitting large functions if variables are far from usage

Before:
```python
def add_items(cart):
    total = 0
    # many lines
    total += item.price
```

After:
```python
def add_items(cart):
    total = 0
    for item in cart:
        total += item.price
```
