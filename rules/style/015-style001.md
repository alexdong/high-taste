Title: Group related declarations or methods together to show structure
ID: STYLE001
Description:
Related methods, variables, and declarations should be grouped together to make the code structure and organization immediately apparent. This visual organization helps developers quickly understand the different responsibilities and capabilities of a class or module.

Problems with scattered related code:
- Class responsibilities are not immediately clear
- Developers must scan the entire class to find related methods
- Code maintenance becomes more difficult
- Related functionality appears unrelated due to distance
- Class organization appears random and unstructured
- Refactoring and testing become more complex

Solutions for effective grouping:
- Group methods by their functional responsibility
- Use comments to label different sections
- Place initialization methods first
- Group public methods before private methods
- Keep related helper methods near their callers
- Use consistent ordering patterns across similar classes
- Consider splitting large classes with many distinct groups

Before:
```python
class Server:
    def open_db(self): ...
    def view(self): ...
    def reply_ok(self): ...
    def close_db(self): ...
```

After:
```python
class Server:
    # DB helpers
    def open_db(self): ...
    def close_db(self): ...

    # Handlers
    def view(self): ...

    # Responses
    def reply_ok(self): ...
```
