Title: Use vertical spacing to group related code
ID: FMT003
Description:
Vertical whitespace should be used strategically to group logically related statements and create visual separation between different conceptual sections of code. This improves readability by helping developers quickly understand code structure and flow.

Problems without proper vertical spacing:
- Code appears as a wall of text that's hard to scan
- Logical groupings are not visually apparent
- Related operations get lost in the noise
- Code structure and flow are harder to understand
- Debugging becomes more difficult due to visual complexity

Solutions for effective vertical spacing:
- Group variable declarations together
- Separate setup, processing, and cleanup sections
- Add space before return statements
- Separate different logical operations
- Use consistent spacing patterns throughout the codebase
- Don't over-use spacing (1-2 blank lines maximum)

Before:
```python
def foo():
    a=1
    b=2
    c=a+b
    return c
```

After:
```python
def foo():
    a = 1
    b = 2

    c = a + b
    return c
```
