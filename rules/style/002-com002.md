Title: Avoid redundant comments that restate the obvious
ID: COM002
Description:
Redundant comments that simply describe what the code does without adding any meaningful context create noise and reduce code readability. These comments often become maintenance burdens because they need to be updated when code changes.

Problems with redundant comments:
- They state information already visible in the code
- They create cognitive overhead for readers
- They require maintenance when code changes
- They can become misleading if not kept in sync
- They suggest the code might be too complex if it needs explanation

Solutions for meaningful comments:
- Focus on business logic and requirements
- Explain non-obvious algorithms or optimizations
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Provide context for unusual workarounds
- Reference external documentation or standards

Before:
```python
# increment counter by one
counter += 1
```

After:
```python
counter += 1  # Compensate for initial warmâ€‘up pass
```
