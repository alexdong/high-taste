Title: Keep comments in sync with code or delete them
ID: COM004
Description:
Comments that become outdated relative to the code they describe are worse than no comments at all. They actively mislead developers and create confusion about the code's actual behavior. Comments must be maintained alongside code changes.

Problems with outdated comments:
- They mislead developers about actual functionality
- They create cognitive dissonance when reading code
- They suggest poor maintenance practices
- They can lead to incorrect assumptions in debugging
- They waste time as developers try to reconcile comment vs code
- They erode trust in all documentation

Solutions for keeping comments current:
- Review comments during every code change
- Delete comments that no longer add value
- Use descriptive function and variable names to reduce comment needs
- Focus on comments that explain "why" rather than "what"
- Include comment review in code review checklists
- Use automated tools to detect comment-code mismatches where possible

Before:
```python
# calculates Euclidean distance
def manhattan_distance(a, b):
    return abs(a.x - b.x) + abs(a.y - b.y)
```

After:
```python
# calculates Manhattan distance
def manhattan_distance(a, b):
    return abs(a.x - b.x) + abs(a.y - b.y)
```
