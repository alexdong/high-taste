Title: Use comments to explain *why*, not *what*
ID: COM001
Description:
Comments should explain the reasoning and intent behind code decisions rather than describing what the code literally does. "What" comments are redundant since the code itself shows what is happening. "Why" comments provide valuable context about business logic, edge cases, and design decisions.

Problems with "what" comments:
- They duplicate information already visible in the code
- They become outdated when code changes but comments don't
- They add noise without providing insight
- They can make code harder to read by stating the obvious

Solutions for meaningful comments:
- Explain business rules and requirements
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Describe complex algorithms and their purpose
- Note workarounds and their reasons
- Clarify non-obvious performance optimizations

Before:
```python
# add 1 to i
i += 1
```

After:
```python
# Compensate for zeroâ€‘based index
i += 1
```
