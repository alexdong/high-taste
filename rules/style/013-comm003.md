Title: Provide edgeâ€‘case examples in comments for tricky functions
ID: COMM003
Description:
Complex functions should include concrete examples that demonstrate edge cases and non-obvious behavior. These examples serve as both documentation and informal tests, helping developers understand the function's behavior without having to trace through the implementation.

Problems without edge-case examples:
- Developers must mentally trace through complex logic
- Non-obvious behaviors are discovered through trial and error
- Edge cases are not immediately apparent
- Function behavior with unusual inputs is unclear
- New team members struggle to understand function contracts
- Debugging becomes more difficult without clear expectations

Solutions for effective examples:
- Include examples in docstrings with expected inputs and outputs
- Show edge cases like empty inputs, boundary values, and special characters
- Use realistic data that might occur in production
- Include examples that demonstrate error conditions
- Show how the function handles unexpected but valid inputs
- Use doctest format when appropriate for executable examples

Before:
```python
def strip_chars(s, chars):
    pass
```

After:
```python
def strip_chars(s: str, chars: str) -> str:
    """Strip any of `chars` from both ends.

    Example:
        >>> strip_chars('abba/a/ba', 'ab')
        '/a/'
    """
    return s.strip(chars)
```
