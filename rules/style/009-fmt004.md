Title: Group functions by feature, not by type
ID: FMT004
Description:
Code should be organized around business features and use cases rather than technical implementation details. This creates more cohesive modules where related functionality is co-located, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

Problems with grouping by type:
- Related functionality is scattered across multiple files
- Developers must search multiple locations to understand a feature
- Changes to a feature require editing multiple unrelated files
- Code coupling is hidden by artificial organizational boundaries
- Testing becomes more complex due to scattered dependencies
- Domain knowledge is fragmented across technical boundaries

Solutions for feature-based organization:
- Group all functions related to a business capability
- Co-locate data structures with their operations
- Organize modules around user stories or use cases
- Keep related validation, processing, and formatting together
- Use domain-driven design principles for module boundaries
- Prefer cohesion over artificial separation

Before:
```python
# File: user_utils.py

def validate_email(email):
    pass

def hash_password(password):
    pass
# elsewhere: report_utils.py
```

After:
```python
# File: user_account.py (featureâ€‘oriented module)

def validate_email(email): ...

def hash_password(password): ...
```
