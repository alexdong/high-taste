Title: Comment intent and reasoning, not what the code literally does
ID: COMM001
Description:
Comments should explain the business logic, reasoning, and intent behind code decisions rather than describing the mechanical operations that are already visible in the code itself. Good comments answer "why" questions that the code cannot express.

Problems with literal code comments:
- They duplicate information already visible in the code
- They add noise without providing insight
- They become outdated when code changes but comments don't
- They suggest the code might be unnecessarily complex
- They waste time during code reading and maintenance
- They can mislead if they become inaccurate

Solutions for meaningful comments:
- Explain business rules and domain requirements
- Document non-obvious algorithms or optimizations
- Clarify assumptions and constraints
- Describe workarounds and their reasons
- Reference external documentation or standards
- Explain complex calculations or formulas
- Note edge cases and error conditions

Before:
```python
# i += 1  # increment i
```

After:
```python
# Use +1 to skip the header row
```
