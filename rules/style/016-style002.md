Title: Align similar assignments to spot anomalies quickly
ID: STYLE002
Description:
When you have a series of similar assignments or declarations, consistent alignment makes patterns and anomalies immediately visible. This visual consistency helps catch typos, missing values, and incorrect patterns during code review and maintenance.

Problems with inconsistent alignment:
- Typos and errors are harder to spot in irregular formatting
- Code appears messy and unprofessional
- Patterns in data structure access become obscured
- Code reviews take longer due to visual noise
- Developers may overlook important differences between similar lines
- Copy-paste errors are less obvious

Solutions for effective alignment:
- Use consistent spacing around assignment operators
- Align similar variable declarations
- Group related assignments together
- Use automatic formatting tools when available
- Apply alignment consistently within logical blocks
- Don't over-align unrelated code
- Consider tabular formatting for complex initialization

Before:
```python
x   = data[0]
y = data[1]
z    = data[2]
```

After:
```python
x = data[0]
y = data[1]
z = data[2]
```
