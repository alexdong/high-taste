Title: Avoid ambiguous pronouns like 'it' in comments
ID: COMM004
Description:
Comments should use specific nouns rather than ambiguous pronouns like "it", "this", or "that". Clear references make comments much easier to understand, especially when read out of context or when multiple objects are involved in the surrounding code.

Problems with ambiguous pronouns:
- Readers must search context to understand what "it" refers to
- Multiple possible referents create confusion
- Comments become unclear when code around them changes
- Pronouns become more ambiguous as code complexity increases
- New team members spend extra time deciphering references
- Comments lose meaning when read in isolation

Solutions for clear references:
- Use specific nouns that clearly identify the object
- Repeat the variable or concept name for clarity
- Use descriptive phrases instead of pronouns
- Be explicit even if it seems repetitive
- Consider restructuring comments to avoid pronoun confusion
- Use "the data", "the result", "the connection" instead of "it"

Before:
```python
# Insert it into cache if it's not too big
```

After:
```python
# Insert the data into cache if its size is acceptable
```
