# Replace Conditional with Polymorphism: Replace type code checks with polymorphic method calls.

**ID**: RF044  
**Category**: Dealing with Generalization â†’ refactoring

## Rule Description
Replace Conditional with Polymorphism: Replace type code checks with polymorphic method calls.

## Before
```python
def pay_amount(employee):
    if employee.type == 'Engineer':
        return employee.monthly_salary
    if employee.type == 'Manager':
        return employee.monthly_salary + employee.bonus
```

## After  
```python
class Employee:
    def pay_amount(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

class Engineer(Employee):
    def pay_amount(self):
        return self.monthly_salary

class Manager(Employee):
    def pay_amount(self):
        return self.monthly_salary + self.bonus
```

## Full Example
```python
# Demonstration of Replace Conditional with Polymorphism before refactoring
def pay_amount(employee):
    if employee.type == 'Engineer':
        return employee.monthly_salary
    if employee.type == 'Manager':
        return employee.monthly_salary + employee.bonus
```
