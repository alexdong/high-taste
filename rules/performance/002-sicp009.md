# Cache results of pure functions whose results only depend on their inputs to avoid redundant work.

**ID**: SICP009  
**Category**: Memoization (Avoid Re‑Computation) → performance

## Rule Description
Cache results of pure functions whose results only depend on their inputs to avoid redundant work.

## Before
```python
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

## After  
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

## Full Example
```python
print([fib(n) for n in range(20)])
```
