## Rule Description
When a recursive solution builds up no deferred operations, rewrite it in an iterative style to avoid growing the call stack.

## Before
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

## After  
```python
def factorial(n):
    acc = 1
    while n > 0:
        acc *= n
        n -= 1
    return acc
```

## Full Example
```python
print(factorial(1000))
```
