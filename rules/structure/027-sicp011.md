# Modules should expose a stable interface and hide their implementation so you can change internals without affecting clients.

**ID**: SICP011  
**Category**: Abstraction Barriers (Modules & Interfaces) â†’ structure

## Rule Description
Modules should expose a stable interface and hide their implementation so you can change internals without affecting clients.

## Before
```python
# geometry.py
PI = 3.14159

def circle_area(r):
    return PI * r ** 2

# client code
import geometry
print(geometry.PI)  # Depends on internal constant
```

## After  
```python
# geometry.py
__all__ = ['circle_area']

from math import pi as _pi

def circle_area(r):
    return _pi * r ** 2

# client code
from geometry import circle_area
print(circle_area(3))
```

## Full Example
```python
from geometry import circle_area
print(circle_area(10))
```
