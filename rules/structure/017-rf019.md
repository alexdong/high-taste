# Inline Class: A class that is not doing much can be collapsed into its caller.

**ID**: RF019  
**Category**: Moving Features Between Objects â†’ structure

## Rule Description
Inline Class: A class that is not doing much can be collapsed into its caller.

## Before
```python
class Range:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.low = low
        self.high = high
    def includes(self, num):
        return self.low <= num <= self.high
```

## After  
```python
# Use a simple tuple instead
low, high = 3, 7
includes = lambda num: low <= num <= high
```

## Full Example
```python
# Demonstration of Inline Class before refactoring
class Range:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.low = low
        self.high = high
    def includes(self, num):
        return self.low <= num <= self.high
```
