# Prefer immutable data and limit side effects: write functions that do not mutate their inputs to ease reasoning and avoid bugs.

## Rule Description
Prefer immutable data and limit side effects: write functions that do not mutate their inputs to ease reasoning and avoid bugs.

## Before
```python
def increment_all(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] += 1  # Mutates caller's list

lst = [1, 2, 3]
increment_all(lst)
print(lst)
```

## After  
```python
def increment_all(nums):
    return [n + 1 for n in nums]

lst = [1, 2, 3]
print(increment_all(lst))
print(lst)  # Original unchanged
```

## Full Example
```python
print(increment_all([1, 2, 3]))
```
