## Rule Description
Decompose Conditional: Move complex condition and action parts into separate functions.

## Before
```python
if date < SUMMER_START or date > SUMMER_END:
    charge = quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge
else:
    charge = quantity * summer_rate
```

## After  
```python
def is_summer(date):
    return SUMMER_START <= date <= SUMMER_END

def summer_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * summer_rate

def winter_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge

charge = summer_charge(quantity) if is_summer(date) else winter_charge(quantity)
```

## Full Example
```python

if date < SUMMER_START or date > SUMMER_END:
    charge = quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge
else:
    charge = quantity * summer_rate
